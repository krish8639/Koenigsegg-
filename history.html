                        narrative takes shape. It begins with a
                        young man who had no track record of
                        car manufacturing and little funding. But
                        he was armed with a deep passion for
                        ultimate performance and a dream to
                        build the world's greatest sports car.

                    <p> After nearly two years in the making,
                        Koenigsegg's concept vehicle – ‘CC’ –
                        was finally driven in public for the first
                        time by Rickard Rydell at an event at
                        Anderstorp race track in 1996. Other
                        race-car drivers to test the prototype
                        included Picko Troberg and Calle
                        Rosenblad. The concept worked
                        spectacularly, and was a great start to
                        introducing Koenigsegg to prospective

                        Koenigsegg CC8S production prototype,

                        to homologate vehicles for sale. It
                        featured an early version of the 655 hp
                        Koenigsegg engine that would later
                        feature in customer cars.

                        2002 and delivered at the Geneva Motor
                        Show in March, 2003. Its minimalistic,
                        clean, styling set it apart from its peers
                        and it laid the foundation for every future

                    <p> The Koenigsegg factory at Margretetorp
                        was a heritage building with a thatched
                        roof. While the roof was a charming
                        element, it was also very susceptible to
                        fire. A fire occurred in February 2003
                        when the company was only two weeks
                        away from showing the CC8S at the
                        Geneva Motor Show. Thankfully, even
                        though it was a Saturday, there were
                        members of staff on site who managed
                        to save vehicles and tooling from the
                        flames. Many other company records
                        were unfortunately lost.

                    <p> The world’s fastest car at the beginning
                        of 2005 was the legendary McLaren F1,
                        with a speed of 386.4 km/h set in 1998.
                        Koenigsegg took the new CCR to Nardo,
                        Italy, in February 2005 to attempt a new
                        record. The car had been at Nardo for a
                        week without breaking the record but
                        the new mark was finally set on the last
                        day, with a new top speed of 387.86
                        km/h recorded. The car was packed up
                        and shipped directly from Nardo to
                        Geneva for the 2005 Geneva Motor
                        Show that afternoon.

                        predecessor, the CCR, but it was no
                        mere evolution. While it retained the
                        traditional Koenigsegg layout –
                        mid-engined V8, carbon fiber tub with a
                        removable and stowable roof – the CCX
                        was a completely new car. It was slightly
                        larger, designed from the ground up with
                        worldwide homologation in mind and
                        meeting all world standards for safety
                        and emissions. The CCX was the first
                        Koenigsegg to be sold into the United
                        States market.

                        launched in 2007 with the worldwide
                        debut of the Koenigsegg CCXR. The
                        CCXR took Koenigsegg’s potent
                        twin-supercharged V8 to a whole new
                        level thanks to a flex-fuel sensor and
                        hardware allowing the car to run on
                        either regular gasoline, E85 (85%
                        ethanol) or any mix in between. The
                        higher octane rating of E85 fuel lifted the
                        total output of the CCXR to 1,018 hp, a
                        record at the time. The CCXR also
                        debuted Koenigsegg’s new Chrono
                        instrument cluster, providing advanced
                        safety and aesthetics.One CCXR model
                        was specially built to allow it to run on
                        E100 fuel. It features a blue ‘R’ badge on
                        the side flank instead of the traditional
                        green.

                        the public debut of the Koenigsegg
                        CCGT race car. The CCGT was
                        developed as a side project with the
                        ambition of racing in the GT1 class at Le
                        Mans. Weighing just under 1,000 kg and
                        with a naturally aspirated V8 engine
                        making 600 hp, the CCGT was very
                        impressive in testing and looked to be
                        very competitive. Sadly, Koenigsegg’s
                        racing ambitions were quashed when
                        the FIA changed the regulations for the
                        GT1 class, imposing higher minimum
                        production numbers that Koenigsegg
                        was unable to meet.

                        in September 2009 – the CCXR ‘Trevita’.
                        The Trevita featured a special proprietary
                        white carbon fiber weave, developed by
                        Koenigsegg especially for this model.
                        Trevita means ‘three whites’ in Swedish
                        and the original intention was to build an
                        edition of three cars. Only two were built,
                        however, tying the Trevita with the CCX
                        Edition as the most exclusive limited run
                        in Koenigsegg’s history.

                        specifically commissioned to see off the
                        CCX-range in style before the arrival of
                        the Agera. The Special Edition featured a
                        special double F1 wing, all-clear-carbon
                        body work, Agera-style rear wheel
                        venting, revised aerodynamics,
                        Koenigsegg’s first ever paddle-shift
                        transmission and a new touchscreen
                        infotainment system for the interior. It
                        was a true bridge between the CCX and
                        Agera models and with just two
                        examples made, it remains one of the
                        rarest Koenigsegg models ever.

                    <p> Agera means “to take action” and there
                        has never been a more appropriate
                        name for a car. The Koenigsegg Agera,
                        unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in
                        March 2010, was Koenigsegg taking
                        action – moving the brand forward into
                        bold, new territory. The Agera featured a
                        new interior highlighted by Koenigsegg’s
                        new ‘ghost’ lighting system. It had
                        Koenigsegg’s new VGR wheels,
                        designed like turbines to extract heat
                        from the car’s brakes. It also marked the
                        change from twin-supercharging to
                        twin-turbocharging. Koenigsegg
                        completely redesigned its exhaust
                        system to virtually eliminate turbo-lag,
                        opening up a world of power-potential
                        while still retaining a light, compact
                        engine package. This allowed the first
                        Ageras to complete with a full 960 hp
                        and over 1,100 Nm of torque – more than
                        enough to ‘take action’ whenever you
                        need. The Agera won the Top Gear
                        Hypercar of the Year award in 2010.

                    <p> By 2011, Koenigsegg had already been
                        working with ethanol fuels for four years
                        and it was only natural that the Agera
                        would receive an engine capable of
                        working with this power-boosting jungle
                        juice. Thus, the Koenigsegg Agera R was
                        born. The Agera R could run on any fuel
                        from 95 octane pump gas to E100
                        biofuel. It produced 960 hp on regular 95
                        octane but this output jumped to a
                        massive 1,140 hp on either E85 or E100,
                        with 1,200 Nm of torque.

                    <p> In 2008, the Koenigsegg CCX set a time
                        of 29.2 seconds for the 0-300-0 km/h
                        run. That’s amazingly fast, even by
                        today’s standards. The Koenigsegg
                        Agera R showed just how far the
                        company had progressed in three short
                        years, with a 0-300-0 time of just 21.19
                        seconds. Margins should be small at the
                        sharp end of the performance segment,
                        but this was a massive 8 second

                    <p> The Koenigsegg Agera S was configured
                        in 2012 for markets where the biofuels
                        needed for maximising output in the
                        Agera R were not available. Thanks to
                        new engine mapping and hardware, the
                        Agera S was the first Koenigsegg to
                        make over 1,000 hp on regular, 95
                        octane pump gasoline, with maximum
                        output of 1,040 hp. The Agera S also saw
                        the debut of Koenigsegg’s AirCore
                        hollow carbonfibre wheels. These
                        revolutionary new wheels weighed 40%
                        less than regular alloy wheels – a
                        massive saving in un-sprung weight that
                        provides both acceleration and handling
                        benefits. Koenigsegg was the first
                        manufacturer to offer carbonfibre wheels
                        on factory built cars and is still the only
                        OEM making its own carbonfibre wheels
                        in-house.

                        power-to-weight ratio. Truly
                        revolutionary. Around 100 kg was shaved
                        from the already-light Agera R to bring it
                        down to 1,360 kg. Koenigsegg matched
                        this with a 1,360 hp twin-turbo V8
                        engine when run on E85 biofuel. The
                        One:1 was the most extreme Koenigsegg
                        ever made, offering blistering
                        acceleration along with an amazing 2 g
                        of lateral grip. Examples of features that
                        were especially developed for the One:1:
                        unique track-optimized aero winglets,
                        extended venturi tunnels and side
                        splitters, Le-Mans inspired and
                        top-mounted active wing configuration
                        and optimized active under trim air
                        management. Large air vents for
                        improved cooling, roof air scoop to
                        support the 1 megawatt of power, 8250
                        RPM rev limit, complemented with
                        custom-made Michelin Cup Tires,
                        upgraded rear Triplex suspension with
                        carbon bevel springs and active shock
                        absorbers and ride height management.
                        The One:1 claimed lap records at
                        Spa-Francorchamps and Suzuka Circuit
                        in 2015. Six customer cars were built,
                        along with one factory development car.

                    <p> Koenigsegg announced a new revolution
                        at Geneva 2015, with the launch of the
                        all-new Koenigsegg Regera. The Regera
                        features three electric motors combined
                        with a powerful twin-turbo V8 and a
                        high-performance, ultra-light battery
                        pack to produce over 1,500 hp. Even
                        more amazing is that all of this power is
                        sent directly to the rear wheels as the
                        Regera has no gearbox. The Regera uses
                        a system called Koenigsegg Direct Drive,
                        which uses the electric motors to propel
                        the car at takeoff with the combustion
                        engine contributing drive from around
                        30 km/h and beyond. The transition from
                        electric to combustion drive is
                        progressive and seamless, providing
                        both blistering performance and the
                        ultimate in comfort. Koenigsegg will
                        build 80 Regeras in total over a period of
                        five years.

                    <p> Koenigsegg used the Geneva Motor
                        Show in March 2015 to show the new
                        Koenigsegg Agera RS. The Agera RS
                        took everything that Koenigsegg learned
                        in the development of the extreme One:1
                        and dialled it back – just a notch – to
                        make a more comfortable version of
                        Koenigsegg’s extreme road and track
                        monster. The Agera RS features
                        Koenigsegg’s highest ever output
                        running only on regular 95-octane
                        gasoline – 1160 hp. It is also a technology
                        powerhouse with advanced
                        aerodynamics, stability management,
                        software updates and active suspension
                        settings stored in the Koenigsegg cloud.
                        All of this is developed and managed
                        in-house at Koenigsegg. The Koenigsegg
                        RS is fully homologated for sale in all
                        countries and 25 units will be produced.

                        back to zero – a pure test of both
                        acceleration and braking.

                        edition of three Agera Final models. The
                        Agera Final edition is based on the
                        Koenigsegg Agera RS but offers
                        unparalleled levels of customization.
                        Owners will be able to specify any
                        equipment from the Koenigsegg options
                        list – free of charge – and Koenigsegg
                        will also work with owners to develop
                        bespoke aerodynamics that will only
                        ever be used on their car. It is the
                        ultimate expression of the Agera
                        philosophy. The first Agera Final edition
                        was built in time for the 2016 Geneva
                        Motor Show and is called the One of
                        One. The two remaining Agera Final
                        editions will be built at the end of the
                        Agera RS production run.

                        achieved five new world records for a
                        production vehicle on November 4th,
                        2017, in Pahrump, Nevada, America.
                        Driven by factory driver, Niklas Lilja, the
                        Agera RS attained the highest top speed
                        for a production vehicle. Calculated
                        using an average of two runs, one in
                        either direction. The record speed
                        achieved is 447.19 km/h (277.87 mph). In
                        the same attempt, it clocked 33.29
                        seconds, going from 0-400-0, beating
                        the previous time of 36.44 seconds set
                        by the same car in Denmark in October
                        2017. The highest average speed for a
                        flying kilometer on a public road was
                        recorded, calculated after running the
                        car in two directions, at 445.63 km/h.
                        Lastly, it also saw the highest speed
                        achieved on a public road (single
                        direction), measured at 457.94 km/h

                    <p> Launched in 2020, the Gemera is the
                        world’s first Mega-GT and Koenigsegg’s
                        first four-seater. Limited to an edition of
                        300 cars, it is an extreme megacar that
                        meets spacious interior and ultimate
                        environmental consciousness. Equipped
                        with the Tiny Friendly Giant engine (or
                        TFG for short) and the proven
                        Koenigsegg Direct Drive, the Gemera
                        has 1.27 megawatts of power and 3500
                        Nm of torque. It can go from 0 to 100
                        km/h in 1.9 seconds and to 400 km/h in
                        record-matching pace.

                        revealed at The Quail. The CC850 is a
                        contemporary reimagining of the CC8S,
                        visually showcasing nods to the first
                        Koenigseggs and the first model to
                        include the Engage Shift System and Get
                        2 Chronocluster. The CC850 is a dual
                        tribute to 20 years of vehicle production
                        as well as the 50th birthday of Christian
