                        <p>You may have seen the ghost that adorns the rear hood
                            over the engine bay of every Koenigsegg, or you may
                            have seen it on our clothing and jewelry. But why a
                            ghost? Well, the reason for this is that the Koenigsegg
                            headquarters in Ängelholm was previously an air force
                            base, and home to one of Sweden’s most legendary air
                            force squadrons – Johan Röd – the Ghost Squadron.
                            The squadron would take off early in the morning and
                            fly until dusk. People heard the planes flying above the
                            clouds but could never quite see them, earning them
                            their ‘Ghost Squadron’ moniker.
                        </p>
                        <p>Koenigsegg inherited the Ghost Squadron’s hangars
                            and runway due to cutbacks in the Swedish military
                            during the early 2000s, rendering the squadron
                            obsolete. The pilots and crew were saddened by this,
                            but happy that a worthy operation took over their
                            fabled site. With this in mind, Koenigsegg was offered
                            their coveted symbol, and was asked to honor the
                            squadron by emblazoning each car with the ghost
                            symbol, just like their fighter jets. As time has passed,
                            Koenigsegg drivers, as well as fans, have come to feel
                            very much like a part of the Ghost Squadron itself. The
                            Ghost Squadron symbol has never shone brighter, and
                            it is now known around the world as the Spirit of
                            Performance.
